There are some JavaScript Problems solved by me during my JavaScript learning period.This questions helped me to build my concepts better.


## JavaScript Questions


1. Password Validator   
Write a JavaScript program that checks if the entered password matches the confirmed password. If the 
passwords match, the program should log "Password Matched. Password validation Successful." to the console. 
Otherwise, it should log "Password didn't match. Password validation unsuccessful" to the console.

2.Calculator
Create a javascript program that takes in two numbers and a string operator. Make use of a switch statement to perform the operation on the two numbers.
The calculator function should
•	Take in two numbers, num1 and num2, and a string representing a mathematical operator, operator
•	Use a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the value of the operator
•	If the operator is one of the four valid operators (+, -, *, /), perform the corresponding mathematical 
•	operation and store the result in a variable called result
•	If the operator is not one of the valid operators, log "Invalid operator" to the console

3.Color Mixer    
Write a JavaScript program that takes in two strings representing colors and uses a switch statement to 
determine the resulting color when the two colors are mixed. The program should print the resulting color 
based on the following criteria
i) If color1 is "red" and color2 is "blue" or vice versa, print "purple"
ii)If color1 is "red" and color2 is "yellow" or vice versa, print "orange"
iii)If color1 is "blue" and `color2" is "yellow" or vice versa, print "green"
iv) If any other combination of colors is input, the program should print "Invalid color combination".

4. Highest Marks    
A teacher wants to find out the highest marks scored by a student in a class of five students. The teacher enters 
the marks of all five students in an array called "marks". Write a program that iterates through the array and 
finds the highest marks scored by any student in the class. The highest marks must then be displayed to the 
teacher using the console. Make sure you use the ternary operator to find the student with the highest marks.

5. Capitalize
You are building a form where users can enter their names. You want to make sure that the first letter of the 
name is always capitalized, even if the user forgets to do so. Write a program that takes in the user's name as a 
string and uses the ternary operator to check if the first letter is lowercase. If it is, the program capitalizes it and 
returns the modified string. Otherwise, it returns the original string without any changes.

6. Vowel Counter    
We want to count the number of vowels in a person's name. Given a name as input, the program should iterate 
through each character in the name, and check if it is a vowel or not. If the character is a vowel, it should be counted.

7. Remove Duplicates    
In an online shopping application, customers can add multiple items to their cart. However, sometimes 
customers accidentally add the same item more than once, resulting in duplicate items in their cart. The 
duplicate items not only make it difficult for the customer to track the items they want to purchase but also 
affect the accuracy of the purchase order.To solve this problem, the application needs to remove duplicate items from the customer's cart. The program should take the customer's cart with duplicates as input, 
and return a new cart without duplicates. Write a program to solve the problem of duplicate items in the cart by removing duplicates.

 8. Inverted right-angled triangle pattern with asterisks
Write a program that takes an integer input i and prints an inverted right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks 
with i rows.
 
9.Check for divisibility.
Write a program that takes an array of numbers and prints all the numbers that are divisible by 3, but not by 2. 
Use a for loop and continue statement.

10.Correct a bug
You are working on an e-commerce website where customers can add items to their cart. The cart stores the 
quantity of each item that the customer wants to purchase in an array of numbers. However, the website is 
currently experiencing a bug where the quantity of each item is being recorded incorrectly by reducing it to 
half. As a result, you need to write a JavaScript function that can double the quantity of each item in the cart 
array to correct the bug. 

11. Unit converter
A local weather station needs to convert temperature data collected in Celsius to Fahrenheit before displaying 
it on its website. They want a function that can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit accurately and efficiently. The 
function should take input in Celsius and return output in Fahrenheit. This function will help the weather station 
to provide temperature readings that are easily understandable to a wider audience.

12. Calculate rental cost
A car rental company needs to calculate the cost of a rental based on the number of days rented and the type 
of car. They require a function that takes in the number of days rented and car type and returns the rental cost. 
The total cost would be the rental cost multiplied by the number of days rented.
The rental costs ar
Economy = Rs. 4000 /- per day
Midsize = Rs. 10,000 /- per day
Luxury = Rs. 20,000 /- per day

13. Bill splitter
A restaurant wants to calculate the total bill for a table based on the cost of each dish and the number of 
people sharing it. They require a function that takes in the cost of each dish and the number of people sharing 
it and returns an object that contains the total bill and the bill to be paid by each person in the group.

14.Calculate the final order price
A retail store needs to calculate the total cost of items in a customer's cart. A customer cart is an array of 
objects with unit price and quantity. Implement an arrow function to calculate the total cost of items, based on 
the unit price and quantity of each item.

15.Calculate the percentage of the discount
A retail store is offering a discount on its products and wants to calculate the percentage of the discount to 
show customers how much they can save. Given the original price and the discounted price of a product, 
implement an arrow function to calculate the percentage of the discount rounded off to two decimal places. 
This function could be useful for the store's marketing team to create promotions and offers that attract 
customers.

16.Generate a random number
Create a JavaScript program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 when the program starts. 
Use a self-invoking arrow function to generate the random number. This program can be used as a component 
in various games or applications that require a random number generator.

17. Build a banking application     
A banking application needs to manage customer accounts and transactions. The user detail is stored in an 
object with a keys name and balance. Write functions using object methods to update a customer's account 
balance based on a deposit or withdrawal. 

18. Change Text on Button click.
Create a simple HTML page with a heading and a button. The initial text must be “The most affordable learning 
platform”, use JavaScript to change the heading text to “PW Skills” when the button is clicked. The button must 
toggle the text of a heading between "The most affordable learning platform" and "PW Skills" on each click.

19. Validate Password
You are building a login form for a website and need to validate user input using JavaScript. The form has two 
input fields: email and password, and a submit button.
Your task is to implement JavaScript code that validates the email and password input fields. The email field 
should contain the "@" symbol. The password field should have a minimum length of 8 characters. If either of 
these conditions is not met, an error message “Invalid email or password!” should be displayed in red color as a 
paragraph text below the form. If the password is valid the message “Valid email and password!” must be 
displayed in green color as a paragraph text below the form.
Your code should run when the user clicks the submit button and should prevent the form from submitting if 
the input is invalid. The input type of email must be text and the input type of password must be password 
without any minLength attribute specified.

21. TODO App    
Create a simple to-do app to add TODO items to the list through an input field and a button.

22.Progress Bar
Create a progress bar that fills up as the user scrolls down the page.

23.Change the color on click
Create a button that utilizes an array of colors and the Math.random method to change the background color 
of the page upon clicking.

24.Text Highlighting
Using the Document Object Model (DOM), highlight all words in a paragraph element that are greater than 8 
characters. The highlighted words should be with a yellow background color.

25. Move the Image
The objective is to write a JavaScript program that enables an image to move according to the direction 
specified by the arrow keys. The program must be able to recognize and respond to the input from the arrow 
keys, and accordingly, update the position of the image on the screen. The program should be able to handle 
the movement of the image in all directions, including up, down, left, and right, in a smooth and responsive 
manner. Have a look at the event key codes before starting the project
